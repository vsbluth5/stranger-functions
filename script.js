// Select the input element using its id, and store that in a variable called textbox

// Log that element to the console just to confirm the query selector worked.

// textbox and #userInput refer to the same thing. The code in this file
// refers to that html element as textbox from now on.

// Challenge: There is one other element in the html that this file will l

// Now we want an event listener to listen to an event (e) to wait for

// Try "input" and "change" for the event type and decide which you prefer

// Check the value property of textbox. This variable is textbox.value

  // Now we can test to see IF have a certain value

  // IF there is another value wgucg us cirrect (else if), we could say something else

    // and if it is wrong (else), we could say...



// Inside of the if Add to the innerHTML property of the pictureBox
// Look at pictureBox.innerTHML in the console.
// Now add to pictureBox.innerHTML
// Use tags like >h3? in the innerHTML and see what happens
// Now add <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/01b27d37-a07e-4e2e-8caf-659256274937%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-08-08%20at%208.39.11%20AM.png?v=1565269664594"/>`;
